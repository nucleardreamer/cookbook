I expect that any of you, my darling children, that try
these recipes, will have questions because it is very
hard for me to tell you exactly how I cook. It is
usually a "by the seat of your pants affair" (no pun
intended) and depends largely upon what is in the
refrigerator. Don't sell left-overs short. Many of the
best dishes that I have cooked during my career as
"Top Chef at 2514 Hudson Place" have evolved because I
wanted to use something up. My grandmother used to say
"Use it up, wear it out and make it over". Remember that
the finest chefs in the world are the French and they are
also the most thrifty group that I have known.

With the exception of cakes , cookies , candy and other
desserts, most of the amounts are pretty loose. There are
no original dessert recipes included here so you should be
able to depend upon those measurements listed. When I write
c. or C., it means cup...A capital T is a tablespoon and a
small t is a teaspoon.

Remember that creating good food is a wonderful and rewarding
pastime. Carry on and change these recipes to suit your own
taste and diet.

Another family quote....from my father...he said "Call me
anything but don't call me late for dinner."

Love,
      Mom,
      Susie,
      Aunt Susie,

## Note from Flynn

I did the best I could at transcribing these ~130 recipes, extract meaning from the overuse of ellipsis, and rationalize some of the seemingly alchemical methods described by Sue Joffray. 

By writing these recipes into a (hopefully) human-readable format, this cook book might have lost a little bit of its soul. When you are reading through these, you won't be able to imagine her talking in your ear as much, but hopefully it will make you cook a little bit better... and not be confused.

If there any mistakes, or you want a little more flavor (no pun intended), you can see the original scans of the cookbook [here](original_cookbook.pdf)
