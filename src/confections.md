## BOMB OR BOMBE OR BOMBA

This is an Italian ice cream cake that Aunt Eleanor was known for. You can make it GOOD or you can make it good for you. The GOOD is absolutely fabulous and the good for you is wonderful if you have never tasted the GOOD...

Use a glass mixing bowl...slather it with butter or margarine. Line it with 1/2 inch thick slices of pound cake. Fill all spaces and press edges together..you will need some triangle shapes to make the slices fit.

The filling will be layers of what you like. The center layer should be vanilla ice cream softened and mixed with nutmeg and chopped maraschino cherries. Some other layers can be chocolate ice cream, peach ice cream, sliced bananas, chocolate flakes (made by spreading melted chocolate bits onto aluminum foil chilling and breaking them up), toasted almond slices, any other ice cream flavor you like...There should be three layers at least. Soften ice cream to add as a layer. Top the last layer with cake slices and press down to make sure there are no empty spaces. Cover and refreeze. When hard again, turn out onto plate by placing in bowl of hot water for 2-3 minutes. With flat top down, frost with whipped cream and Decorate with halved cherries, nuts, whatever you like. Refreeze and remove 10-15 min. before serving. To make it good FOR you, can substitute frozen yogurts for ice cream, angelfood cake and low fat topping. If you frost with low fat topping, wait until just before serving because it "dies". Aunt Eleanor served the slices with hot fudge sauce at the table, but I've never had the nerve to make it THAT GOOD. This just looks like a long recipe..it is actually very easy to do. My favorite is with peach and chocolate ice cream on the top and bottom with the vanilla nutmeg mix in the center, divided with toasted almonds, sliced bananas and chocolate flakes.
