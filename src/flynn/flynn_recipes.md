# Flynn's Recipes

I don’t have many special recipes, but the ones listed here are worth writing down. Some are mine, modified from my time in Japan and Korea, and some are part of the cöökböök my partner Hannah and I keep together.

## Bulgogi (불고기)

Do not skip on any of these ingredients, the recipe done right needs all these things!

- 1/2 cup of crushed Korean pear (or asian pears specifically)
- 1/4 cup onion puree
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger, minced
- 1 green onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoon brown sugar (or 1 tablespoons of brown sugar and 1+1/2 tablespoons rice syrup)
- 2 tablespoon soy sauce
- a pinch of ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1/2 carrot, sliced thin

Meat options:
- (best) 1 pound of beef tenderloin, cut into thin slices 1/2 inch x 2 inch and 1/8 inch thick
- (decent) 1 pound beef short ribs, thin sliced into strips 1/2 inch wide

Instructions:
1. Mix everything in a bowl, keep in fridge for _minimum_ 30 minutes. Best is overnight!
2. Grill, fry in a pan, or BBQ over medium-high heat - these cook quick, so probably no more a minute per side. Best is over an open flame on a grill, but cast iron grill pan or skillet will work too. Stir fry is the last option.
3. Best served with [ssamjang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssamjang) (dipping sauce) and garlic cloves in a lettuce wrap. If you aren't into making korean food, it's best to buy that sauce from an asian market. Honestly, the bulgogi is great just by itself.
